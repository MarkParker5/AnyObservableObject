# AnyObservableObject
Equivalents to SwiftUI's property wrappers but without compile-time type restrictions. The lack of compile-time restrictions means that you don't need generics if you defined type as a protocol.

You can find examples in the [MarkParker5/TwiTreads](https://github.com/MarkParker5/TwiTreads) project.
